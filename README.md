# Bankito
## Project Description
This Project Focusses on developing an online banking system.The main aim is to create an online banking platform that is accessible from any location, so customers need not go to the bank branches for routine banking operations like money withdrawal, Money transfer, balance inquiry etc.
Visiting the physical branches of banks is not only time consuming but can also be hectic, like to stand in a long queues and waiting time. Not to forget running to bank for every minor banking task creates unnecessary burden on bank staff. These issues can be addressed by developping an online banking system that will offer seamless and prompt banking service to customers. However, to use this software application, a user must be registered with the system. To do so, the user has to create a unique username and password for securely logging into the application.
